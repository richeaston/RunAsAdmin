Run applications as another user, but with administrative rights

# pre-requisites required #
you must have the Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore module installed prior to use.
first run must be done as admin, you will be asked to create a password for your local secretstore (remember this no none transferable, and will only work on your pc/laptop) subsequent running can be done as a normal user account
